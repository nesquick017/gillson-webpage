          Ever since I can remember I had a passion for movement in all kinds of ways! After playing
          football for 15 years, I discovered breakdancing and acrobatics. I realized the capacity
          and the potential my body had when in motion. So I started to learn more about movement
          from Ido Portal and other teachers and made my own practice and teaching become my
          everyday life. I want to help people to unlock the full potential of their bodies and to
          become better movers. Gaining strength, improving mobility, learning skills and
          discovering what is possible to do with one's own body is what I want to share with my
          students.
